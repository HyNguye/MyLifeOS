Welcome to my first GitHub project! 
I created this project purely for fun, but I also wanted to share how the appRunning queue works.
The main functionality of the appRunning queue is as follows:
1. Pushing an app: When you click to open an app, it is added to the appRunning queue.
2. Turning an app into '': When you close an app, it is marked as '' in the queue.
3. Filtering running apps: The appRunning queue filters out all the '' (closed) apps, displaying only the currently running apps.
I would greatly appreciate it if you could leave a comment to help me improve this functionality. 
Your feedback is invaluable to me. Thank you for your support and love!
