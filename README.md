<h1>Welcome to my first GitHub project! </h1><br/>
<h3>I created this project purely for fun, but I also wanted to improve my skill</h3> 
<h3>The main functionality of the appRunning queue is as follows:</h3><br/>
1. Pushing an app: When you click to open an app, it is added to the appRunning queue.<br/>
2. Turning an app into '': When you close an app, it is marked as '' in the queue.<br/>
3. Filtering running apps: The appRunning queue filters out all the '' (closed) apps, displaying only the currently running apps. (Only when there are no running apps anymore)<br/>
<br/>
 <i>I would greatly appreciate it if you could leave a comment to help me improve this functionality. 
Your feedback is invaluable to me. Thank you for your support and love!</i>
